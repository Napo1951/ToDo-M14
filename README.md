<h2>To Do List Activities</h2>
<p>Let's create a To Do List, Where people can Add and Remove Activities on their Own</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A <strong>To Do List</strong> is a method that people use to remember what they have to do during a day at work, <br> 
like attending a meeting, submit the monthly report which is due, on a special day at home or during vacations. 
On this activity, Users will have the opportunity to <em>Add</em> or <em>Remove</em> activities base on their schedule.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>To add a new activity, user can just click on the row with the Plus + sign, <br>
and to remove activity, user can only click the activity that they want to remove</p>
